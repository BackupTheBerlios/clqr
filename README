Common Lisp Quick Reference is a free (see file COPYING) booklet with
short descriptions of the thousand or so symbols defined in the ANSI
standard.


It builds well on a Debian system with the packages

  texlive-metapost,
  texlive-latex-recommended,
  texlive-latex-extra,

and their dependencies installed.  If you have them all in place, type

  $ make

and be patient.

If you end up with three blank pages at the end you can try to blank a
fourth page by changing

  \renewcommand{\clearpagebeforeindex}{\clearpage}

to

  \renewcommand{\clearpagebeforeindex}{}

in file paper-<your-papersize>.tex.
