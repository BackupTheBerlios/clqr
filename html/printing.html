	  <h3>Printing</h3>
	    Chose a file which has your paper size (i.e. "-a4-" or "-letter-")
	    and "-booklet-" in its name. Then, a page order suitable for
	    nested folios is indicated by "-all"; if you want the folios
	    stacked take a file which says "-four".
	  <p>
	    That is clqr-&lt;paper size&gt;-booklet-&lt;page order&gt;.pdf
	  <p>
	    On a duplex printer, just print the file. If your printer
	    can only print one side of the sheet, start with the odd
	    pages. Depending on your printer's paper handling, you may
	    or may not have to rearrange the half-printed sheets. Make
	    sure the first page is on top and put them back into the
	    paper tray in order to print the even pages.
	    

	  <h3>Bookbinding</h3>
	  <p>
	    One by one, fold the pages in half lengthwise. 
	  <p>
	    As to the nested version, if you have a big enough
	     (saddle stitch) stapler, put two staples along the spine.
	    Alternatatively, you can sew the pages together with a
	     heavy thread. Or you simply let the pages unbound.
	    The edges of the paper opposite the spine will not line up
	     perfectly here.
	  <p>
	    The variant with stacked folios is suitable for wire
	    or comb binding, or you put some elastic glue along the spine.
	  <p>
	    Currently, I would recommend not to take too much pains
	    and rather come back later for an improved revision.
